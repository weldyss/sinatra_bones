h1. sinatra_template

Sinatra is an awesome framework for small, and as some might call, "unstructured" applications. But it is also really good for bigger and traditional web apps. In this realm, I really like the way Rails organizes the app's files. Also, it is a structure very well known by many developers, so using it is a win-win situation.

Does sinatra_template helps your daily work with Ruby? So, "please recommend me":http://workingwithrails.com/recommendation/new/person/9370-lucas-h-ngaro on Working With Rails. Thanks for your kindness! :)

h2. Why?

Sinatra is cool. Templates are cool. Cool + Cool = AWESOME! ;)

h2. How?

To use it, just clone this repo (or fork and clone your own) and start developing your application. You probably want to replace occurrences of MyApp with your app's name.

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
